### "A Mobile Network Operators Consulting"

Mobile networks have become both the generators and carriers of massive data. Big data analytics can improve the performance of mobile networks and maximize the revenue of operators. Big data technology brings about new opportunities to telecom operators faced with increasingly complex networks. Operators can use Big data technology to improve operational efficiency and network intelligence. A significant feature of Big data analytics is real-time processing. With Big data analytics, operators can monitor their infrastructure in real-time, and make autonomous plus dynamic decisions, and schedule activities. This creates new market opportunities, optimizes the network, minimizes operation and maximizes the revenue of operators. Consulting software will certainly bring great benefits such as user satisfaction, operation efficiency, and business innovation for telecom operators.

### BIG DATA FOR MOBILE OPERATORS
<P>   Big data fundamentally is not only storing and managing data – it is also deploying powerful real-time analytics and visualization tools, collaboration platforms and the ability to automatically create links with existing applications vital to the operator’s business. The first step is to collect data from a variety of sources such as network and non-network, structured and unstructured.</P>
<P>   Big data technology can address problems associated with rapid data growth, scalability, and high cost. Telecom operators might produce 10TB of raw data per day and store the same in a file format. After processing, data is reduced to 550 GB and saved in a database format. This data is often archived for a long time. Handling such a large amount of data is quite difficult for the traditional file system with a relational database.</P>
<P>   A NoSQL database can handle up to a PB of data and moreover, a stream handling and analysis platform can handle huge amounts of event data in real time, also it can handle standardization and integrity of inputs. </P>
<P>   Today, Big data is understood more or less from a technology perspective: the possibility of better storage (volume), the ability to process information and make it available in real-time (velocity) and the ability to deal with various kinds of data sources, including structured, semi-structured and unstructured ones (variety). </P>

### DATA COLLECTION 
<P> Big data in mobile networks can be obtained from either internal or external sources. Data collection methods can be divided into two categories: </P> 
1.	Through data sources.<BR />
2.	Via auxiliary tools. <BR />
<P>The data comes from Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Operation/Business Support Systems (OSS/BSS), drive test equipment, walk test equipment, network planning, performance management, fault management, marketing & sales plan, configuration management, signaling data, transmission data and geological locations. </P>

#### A.	DATA SOURCE COLLECTION
<p>The mobile service provider needs to support data collection as shown in Figure 1, from various heterogeneous data sources in order to accurately reflect the quality of end-to-end services and customer experience. Some data sources include: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Customer Relation Management:</i> This includes detailed customer information such as subscription profile, IMSI, trouble ticket, and SLA.</li>
<li><i>Active Probing:</i> This includes test pack that is added to the existing network to obtain end-to-end metric data.</li>
<li><i>Passive Probing:</i> This is used when professional staff puts probes into the network interfaces, such as A/Gn interfaces, etc. to collect the signaling data.</li> 
<li><i>Performance Management:</i> This includes network access KPIs and network element KPIs, both of which are obtained through the OMC or NMS interface.</li>
<li><i>xDR data:</i> This includes MR, CDR and TDR data, which are delivered through relative interfaces on the equipment.</li>
<li><i>Configuration Management:</i> This provides detailed configuration data for network elements, including but not limited to eNodeB, MME, SGW, PGW, HSS, SGSN, MSC, and BSC/RNC.</li>
<li><i>Site Inventory:</i> This provides site information based on a date such as a site type, tower height, radio, transmission equipment, antenna type, azimuth, power system, tilts, etc.</li>
</ul>

#### B.	FROM DATA TO INSIGHT 
<p>Successful decision-making will increasingly be derived from analytics-generated insights. The more accurate and timely they are, the better chance a decision-maker has to anticipate and profit from change. The key to effective data-driven decision-making is the ability to sift through large amounts of data; and the ability to combine data from several sources to gain a more comprehensive view of the problem. For example, drive test comparisons combined with performance data, fault management, and physical antenna characteristics.</p>
<p>Insights may be derived from properly correlated data. Insights can be exposed through an integrated and interactive platform that implements or reuses existing APIs and SDKs, allowing multiple applications to be supported by the same underlying data infrastructure. Overall, insights can dynamically change network performance to ensure an optimal subscriber experience.</p>

#### C.	ANALYSIS AND PREPROCESSING 
<p>The large-scale collected datasets reside at different locations with different formats. Thus, the gathered datasets are usually in a raw state with much redundancy, inconsistency or useless information. Meanwhile, the complicated vast amount of semi-structured and unstructured data make it impossible to fit them into the relational database with tables of columns & rows. NoSQL databases are becoming the alternative technology for Big data. To avoid unnecessary storage space, and ensure the processing efficiency, the data should be preprocessed to be ready for data analysis, before it is loaded into the database. These processes also involve massive distributed file systems, parallel computing frameworks, NoSQL databases, real-time streaming processing, intelligent pattern recognition, natural language understanding, and expert knowledge bases. For example, in order to correlate and normalize the dataset, the data collected from mobile Apps, geolocation, network logs, CDRs, and weblogs will not be stored directly in a storage system until it is preprocessed. Three common data preprocessing techniques are integration, cleaning and redundancy elimination.</p>

#### D.	BIG DATA ANALYTICS PLATFORMS AND TOOLS 
<p>“Apache Hadoop” is an open-source software framework for distributed storage and distributed processing of large-scale datasets. The power of clusters enforces Hadoop to store and process data at high-speed. Initially, Hadoop was developed for routine functions as a keyword classification on search engines. To cater for the requirements of various business applications, Hadoop gradually turned into general-purpose Big data operating platforms, where different data manipulations and data analytical operations can be plugged into. All the features make Hadoop particularly adept at processing or analyzing the data in mobile networks, such as Network KPI, CRM, drive test result, marketing plan, etc. this data needs to be retrieved from storage systems for analysis frequently. Meanwhile, various suitable data analysis methods for mobile networks can be integrated into Hadoop platforms.</p>
