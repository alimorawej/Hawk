<p><b>AI:</b> Artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><b>Cell:</b> the node in the mobile network where the wireless connection is stablished with the mobile device (Mobile handset).</p>
<p><b>Serving Cell:</b> The main cell where the wireless link is established with the mobile device.</p>
<p><b>A cell site or cell tower:</b> Is a cellular telephone site where antennae and electronic communications equipment are placed.</p>
<p><b>Neighbor Cell:</b> is the cell site that a mobile device with which will establish a connection after moving away from the original cell and getting closer to that cell.</p>
<p><b>CDR:</b> Call detail record is a data record produced by a telephone exchange or other telecommunications equipment that documents the details of a telephone call or other telecommunications transaction (e.g., text message) that passes through that facility or device.</p>
<p><b>Service provider (Operator):</b> The mobile network operator such as AT&T.</p>
<p><b>Frequency Planning:</b> In the context of mobile radio communication systems, RF Planning is the process of assigning frequencies, transmitter locations and parameters of a wireless communications system to provide sufficient coverage and capacity for the services required.</p>
<p><b>Rehoming:</b> A method, system, and apparatus enables automatic radio base station (RBS) rehoming from a first radio network controller (RNC) to a second RNC when the first RNC becomes overloaded and/or automatic resource sharing between/among RNCs when one RNC becomes overloaded.</p>
<p><b>RAC:</b> Routing Area Code is a fixed length of 1 octet and identifies a routing area within a location area. The RAC is part of the RAI (Routing Area Identity).</p>
<p><b>NoSQL:</b> database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.</p>
<p><b>SLA:</b> Service Level Agreement is a contract between a service provider and a customer.</p>
<p><b>IMSI:</b> The International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) is an internationally standardized unique number to identify a mobile subscriber.</p> 
<p><b>A/Gn interface:</b> an interface is a logical link connection or a reference point, between two components in telecommunication infrastructure Gn interface between SGSN and a GGSN.</p>
<p><b>KPI:</b> key performance indicator is a measure of performance. Such measures are commonly used to help an organization define and evaluate how successful it is, typically in terms of making progress towards its long-term organizational goals.</p>
<p><b>OMC:</b> Operations and Maintenance Center is connected to all equipment in the switching system and to the BSC. The implementation of OMC is called the operation & support system (OSS).</p>
<p><b>NMS:</b> Network Management System is an application or set of applications that lets network administrators manage a network's independent components inside a bigger network management framework. NMS may be used to monitor both software and hardware components in a network.</p>
<p><b>TDR:</b> Time-Domain Reflectometer is an electronic instrument that uses time-domain reflectometry to characterize and locate faults in metallic cables (for example, twisted pair wire or coaxial cable). It can also be used to locate discontinuities in a connector, printed circuit board, or any other electrical path.</p>
<p><b>MME:</b> Mobility Management Entity plays an important role in LTE EPC architecture. In fact, MME is the main signaling node in the EPC. According to LTE University, LTE MME is responsible for initiating paging and authentication of the mobile device.</p>
<p><b>SGW & PGW:</b> Serving Gateway (SGW) is a critical network function for the 4G mobile core network, known as the evolved packet core (EPC). The SGW resides in the user plane where it forwards and routes packets to and from the eNodeB and packet data network gateway (PGW).</p>
<p><b>HSS:</b> Home Subscribe Server is the main IMS database which also acts as database in EPC. The HSS is a super HLR that combined legacy HLR and AuC functions together for CS and PS domains.</p>
<p><b>MSC:</b> Mobile Switching Centre is a telephone exchange that makes the connection between mobile users within the network, from mobile users to the public switched telephone network and from mobile users to other mobile networks.</p>
<p><b>RNC:</b> Radio Network Controller is a governing element in the UMTS radio access network (UTRAN) and is responsible for controlling the Node Bs that are connected to it.</p>
<p><b>API:</b> An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of standard software functions an application can use. ... An API is also known as middleware. The use of APIs makes it possible to develop applications and services independently of the underlying device it will run on.</p>
<p><b>SDK:</b> Software Development Kit should facilitate development of new telecom services such as network plug-ins.</p>
<p><b>CRM:</b> Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is an integrated management information system that is used to schedule, plan and control the sales and pre-sales activities in an organization.</p>
